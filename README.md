This project is a continuation of the original **[PTP (Pear Texture Pack)](https://github.com/Pairman/PTP)** developed by Pairman.  
After its discontinuation, **LIPiston** took over as the primary maintainer, with major contributions from **LIPiston**, **MouFengcoo**, **LYOfficial**, and **Smallcoral**.

### **PTP (Pear Texture Pack)**  
- PTP is a **16x minimalist-style texture pack** created by **Pairman** on **November 2, 2014**. Originally designed for Minecraft Pocket Edition, it evolved into a comprehensive texture pack covering nearly all in-game textures. Updated over five years, it aims to provide a comfortable visual experience for both Minecraft **Bedrock Edition** and **Java Edition**. The pack features clean colors, consistent aesthetics, and subtle customizations (e.g., classic blue roses, lotus leaves/flowers). It suits survival, building, and Redstone gameplay. Development paused in 2018.  

### **FPP (Frozen Pear Pack)**  
- FPP is the **revived version** maintained by **LIPiston**, focusing on updating textures for post-2018 content. Current updates include full support for **1.16**, with ongoing work for **1.17**. Major contributors: **LYOfficial**, **LIPiston**, **MouFengcoo**.  

### **PPP (Pbr Pear Pack)**  
- PPP is a **shader extension pack** led by **MouFengcoo**, designed to unify custom models and enhance visual effects. It is currently bundled with FPP v8.3 (for MC 1.16) but will soon become a standalone add-on to reduce the main pack’s size.  

### **BRP (Blood Redstone Pear) [Deprecated]**  
- BRP was a **Redstone-focused extension** developed by **Smallcoral** (with contributions from **LYOfficial** and **PistonBrain**). It aimed to improve Redstone component visibility but is no longer maintained.
